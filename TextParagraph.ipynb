            "âI think it speaks to the strength of what weâre building and really gives us that confidence going into Season 2.â But when it came to the seasonâs eventual uptick, reaching a pre-playoffs peak of 115k viewers with the New York Home Series in July, Faries said it turned around when they were able to shift their focus from pivoting to remote play to the content itself.\n",
            "âWhen we poured our focus and our creative muscle behind not only operating in a seamless way in light of COVID-19, but then really being able to optimize the fan experience with a content-first lens, you saw immediately the growth that we started to enjoy.â And now that CDL has crossed the finish line on its inaugural season, itâs already announced one big particular dramatic change for the 2021 cycle: a move from 5v5 to 4v4 in âBlack Ops Cold War.â While itâs a decision that has been applauded by many fans as a return to the roots of âCall of Dutyâ esports and one that makes for more competitive gameplay, itâs also one that presents an inevitable numbers problem: now that the 12 franchises have built five-player teams of the best âCall of Dutyâ players in the world, they now have to bench one of those players or cut them altogether.\n",
            "Itâs already started to play out in the off season, with James âClaysterâ Eubanks becoming a free agent just days after winning the championship title with the Dallas Empire.\n",
            "Its big season-ending event, Champs, which saw the Dallas Empire claim the inaugural championship title, drew record-shattering numbers this past weekend, not just for the league, but âCall of Dutyâ esports at large.\n",
            "Faries also confirms news first broken by ESPN earlier this week that CDL has no plans to expand beyond its 12 teams in 2021, meaning there wonât be extra slots in that respect.\n",
            "A bizarre season of Call of Duty League action finally saw a champion being crowned this weekend.\n",
            "This has been a particularly volatile Call of Duty League offseason due to the announcement that the upcoming Treyarch game of Black Ops: Cold War will have 4v4 gameplay instead of the 5v5 gameplay of Modern Warfare, necessitating at least one roster cut from every team in the league.\n",
            "Although the RÃKKR started off strong this year on LAN, they had disappointing finishes when the league had to go online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "So in many respects, it was informed, it was done in deep discussion with so many people who play a role in making sure that weâre delivering the best possible fan experience.â Looking forward even further, Faries says she has ânothing to announce yetâ in regards to whether the league will open up franchise slots in 2022, adding that theyâre âfocused on delivering a really fundamentally exciting and stronger product output in Season 2.â And as far as getting back to their in-person plans next year, itâs dependent on the pandemic.\n",
            "Atlanta was by far the best CDL team in the regular season, going 26-7 and finishing with a league-high 280 points.\n"
