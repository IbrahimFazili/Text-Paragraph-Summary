# Text-Paragraph-Summary
Why summarize yourself when you can get a machine to summarize for you?

Uses the GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representations) and PageRank algorithm to extract the most common and important sentences from the articles to give you a summar!

## How to make it work
You need to download the csv file and upload it to your Google Drive
Then run the Jupyter notebook file on Google Colab
If you would like for it summarize articles of your choice, then in the csv file under 'article_text' replace each cell with text from articles you'd like to summarize
