1,Multiple Call of Duty League teams release players,"Multiple Call of Duty League teams released players from their lineups Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, the Minnesota RØKKR released all of their 2020 players: Obaid ""Asim"" Asim, Kaden ""Exceed"" Stockdale, Devin ""TTinyy"" Robinson, Alex ""Alexx"" Carpenter, Adam ""Assault"" Garcia, Adam ""GODRX"" Brown, and Justin ""SiLLY"" Fargo-Palmer. Although the RØKKR started off strong this year on LAN, they had disappointing finishes when the league had to go online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Minnesota finished eighth in the regular season and were eliminated by OpTic Gaming Los Angeles in the second round of the losers bracket at the Call of Duty League championship. The London Royal Ravens released nearly the entirety of their 2020 roster, including Bradley ""Wuskin"" Marshall, Matthew ""Skrapz"" Marshall, Thomas ""Dylan"" Henderson, Trei ""Zer0"" Morris, Rhys ""Rated"" Price, Dylan ""MadCat"" Daly, and Byron ""Nastiee"" Plumridge, on Tuesday. With this roster in 2020, the Royal Ravens finished sixth overall in the regular season and fourth at champs. The Paris Legion also released their 2020 roster of Denholm ""Denz"" Taylor, Luka ""Louqa"" Rigas, Conrad ""Shockz"" Rymarek, Zach ""Zed"" Denyer, Matthew ""KiSMET"" Tinsley, Timothy ""Phantomz"" Landis, and Paul ""Brezy"" Breszynski. Paris finished 10th in the regular season and 10-11 in champs. OpTic Gaming Los Angeles released Brandon ""Dashy"" Otell, who had been with the OpTic organization since late 2018 and stayed through the sale of the organization prior to franchising. Dashy was on the starting lineup at the beginning of the year but was benched midseason. OpTic Gaming LA also released Darien ""Hollow"" Chverchko, Jevon ""Goonjar"" Gooljar-Lim, and Martin ""Chino"" Chino. Not to be left out of the roster shuffle, the Chicago Huntsmen released the high-profile twin-brother duo of Alec ""Arcitys"" Sanderson and Preston ""Prestinni"" Sanderson. Prestinni joined the team midseason from the Florida Mutineers after Chicago benched Peirce ""Gunless"" Hillman (who was released by the team, according to his Twitter). The Huntsmen finished fourth overall in the regular season and third in the Call of Duty League championship. This has been a particularly volatile Call of Duty League offseason due to the announcement that the upcoming Treyarch game of Black Ops: Cold War will have 4v4 gameplay instead of the 5v5 gameplay of Modern Warfare, necessitating at least one roster cut from every team in the league.",https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/29839343/multiple-call-duty-league-teams-release-players
2,Call of Duty League championship results: Dallas Empire embarrass Atlanta FaZe,"A bizarre season of Call of Duty League action finally saw a champion being crowned this weekend.  The Dallas Empire steamrolled their way to a title and $1.5 million grand prize with a 5-1 championship match win over the Atlanta FaZe. Atlanta was by far the best CDL team in the regular season, going 26-7 and finishing with a league-high 280 points. Dallas finished second with 260 points. But FaZe were no match for the Empire in postseason competition, losing twice to their rival this weekend.",https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/other-sports/news/call-of-duty-league-championship-schedule-bracket/1bf3t0z29bf9j1peawdkl1s6eu
3,"Call of Duty League Commissioner on the Inaugural Season, Champs and the Move to 4v4","Activision Blizzard had big plans for its inaugural season of the Call of Duty League (CDL) in 2020. Those plans focused largely on in-person events, with teams traveling from city to city, where fans could cheer on their favorite franchises from packed arenas. As lockdown orders spread across the U.S., the CDL (and its sister league, the Overwatch League) had to quickly pivot, moving to an online-only format in March. In addition to the adjustment to remote play and broadcast, it was still finding its footing on its new exclusive partner of YouTube, with viewership lagging particularly in March and early April. But the league is enjoying something of a victory lap now. Its big season-ending event, Champs, which saw the Dallas Empire claim the inaugural championship title, drew record-shattering numbers this past weekend, not just for the league, but “Call of Duty” esports at large. It peaked at more than 330k viewers, including co-streams, making it the most-viewed “Call of Duty” esports event ever (the previous confirmed peak for a “Call of Duty” esports event was around 200k, according to the league). “To finish as strong as we did, to see fans tune in and show up for the biggest moment of the year like that, amidst that pandemic, amidst all the pivots we’ve had to make, was really awesome and such a huge achievement for us,” CDL commissioner Johanna Faries tells Variety. “I think it speaks to the strength of what we’re building and really gives us that confidence going into Season 2.” “To finish as strong as we did, to see fans tune in and show up for the biggest moment of the year like that, amidst that pandemic, amidst all the pivots we’ve had to make, was really awesome and such a huge achievement for us,” CDL commissioner Johanna Faries tells Variety. “I think it speaks to the strength of what we’re building and really gives us that confidence going into Season 2.” But when it came to the season’s eventual uptick, reaching a pre-playoffs peak of 115k viewers with the New York Home Series in July, Faries said it turned around when they were able to shift their focus from pivoting to remote play to the content itself. “I think a lot of it was about making sure we could align on content plans, get smarter in partnership with YouTube, for example,” she says, noting that the CDL’s YouTube page passed 1 million subscribers early last month. “When we poured our focus and our creative muscle behind not only operating in a seamless way in light of COVID-19, but then really being able to optimize the fan experience with a content-first lens, you saw immediately the growth that we started to enjoy.” And now that CDL has crossed the finish line on its inaugural season, it’s already announced one big particular dramatic change for the 2021 cycle: a move from 5v5 to 4v4 in “Black Ops Cold War.” While it’s a decision that has been applauded by many fans as a return to the roots of “Call of Duty” esports and one that makes for more competitive gameplay, it’s also one that presents an inevitable numbers problem: now that the 12 franchises have built five-player teams of the best “Call of Duty” players in the world, they now have to bench one of those players or cut them altogether. It’s already started to play out in the off season, with James “Clayster” Eubanks becoming a free agent just days after winning the championship title with the Dallas Empire.  Faries also confirms news first broken by ESPN earlier this week that CDL has no plans to expand beyond its 12 teams in 2021, meaning there won’t be extra slots in that respect. She says the decision to move to 4v4 was made “in collaboration with our teams, our owners, our GMs, our coaches, our players” after months of dialogue.  “A lot of it was about thinking ecosystem first,” she says. “There was so much feedback coming in from different stakeholders about the merit of making such a move. So in many respects, it was informed, it was done in deep discussion with so many people who play a role in making sure that we’re delivering the best possible fan experience.” Looking forward even further, Faries says she has “nothing to announce yet” in regards to whether the league will open up franchise slots in 2022, adding that they’re “focused on delivering a really fundamentally exciting and stronger product output in Season 2.” And as far as getting back to their in-person plans next year, it’s dependent on the pandemic. While that aspect is still “critically important” for them, Faries feels confident about their ability to carry on remotely if needed. Launching off of the success of Champs, Faries notes that they “need to find really special ways to reward our ‘Call of Duty’ player base, and to establish CDL as a place to really go as a viewer and as a player for unique rewards and unique experiences” moving forward. “It goes without saying, this has been a very challenging year, and in many ways challenges that no one could’ve controlled or expected,” she says. “So backs really against the wall, the CDL teams and the CDL family writ large still delivered, and still really put this league on the map because we know how strong a product it really is and can become.”",https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/call-of-duty-league-champs-4v4-johanna-faries-1234759148/
